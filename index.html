  <h1>Kill Bill</h1>

  <h2>"Revenge is dish best served cold"</h2>

  <p>Kill Bill is multi-layered movie about disception and revenge. 
    The entire movie is split into two volumes and the scenes tend to bounce back and forth between the past and present day of the film.
    A former assassin, known simply as The Bride (Uma Thurman), wakes from a coma four years after her jealous ex-lover Bill (David Carradine) attempts to murder her on her wedding day. 
    Fueled by an insatiable desire for revenge, she vows to get even with every person who contributed to the loss of her unborn child, her entire wedding party, and four years of her life. 
    After devising a hit list, The Bride sets off on her quest, enduring unspeakable injury and unscrupulous enemies.
